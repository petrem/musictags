1. Bugs and tests to perform

- check behavior for missing id3 tag
- check behavior for older id3 versions

2. Enhancements

2.1 Album detection: when some files in a dir have the same TALB, assume dir is an album. Then the album score should depend on this.

2.2. Display expected but missing tags

2.3 Check actual file name to conform to a specified format

2.4 Check TOFN (original file name)

2.5 Add simple fixes: rename, fill in TOFN
